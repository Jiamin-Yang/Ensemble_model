1) Purpose: making the Table 1
Materials: lastmodel_select_10feature.ipynb (the AUC-ROC of the models with different algorithms in layer 3 is in this file)

2) Purpose: geting the AUC-ROC of the models with different algorithms in layer 3
Script: lastmodel_select_10feature.ipynb (in first, second and third folders)
Material: pred_*_*_set_*.csv

3) Purpose: geting pred_*_*_set_*.csv
Script: calculate_midout_file_ensemble_run.ipynb
Materials: main_set_plus_*.csv, external_set_plus_*.csv
Note:main_set_plus_*.csv, external_set_plus_*.csv and calculate_midout_file_ensemble_run.ipynb are the same in Figure 3 folder.

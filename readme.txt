1.Predicting GPR40 Agonists with A Deep Learning-Based Ensemble Model containing the data and models for reproduce the results.

2.model file contains our ensemble model, with which we can predict whether a compound is a GPR40 agonist.

3. env.yaml contains the packages in conda environment. Among these packages, there are several necessary, such as molmap, chemprop, xgboost, scikit-learn and so on.
